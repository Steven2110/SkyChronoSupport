# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 23, 2025_

**SkyChrono** does not collect or store user data on external servers. All calculations and app preferences are processed on your device.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
- **No External Data Collection**: SkyChrono does not upload, transmit, or sell personal data.
- **On-Device Processing**: Astronomical calculations (sun/moon positions, twilight times, and time systems) are computed locally on your device.
- **Local Storage (If Used)**: Any app settings (theme, formatting preferences, notification preferences) are stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms.

## 2. Permissions
SkyChrono may request optional permissions to enable certain features:
- **Location (Optional)**: If you enable GPS-based positioning, your location is used only to compute local astronomical data. Location data is not sent to external servers.
- **Notifications (Optional)**: If enabled, notifications are scheduled and delivered by iOS on your device.

You can use SkyChrono without granting these permissions by entering location manually and disabling notifications.

## 3. Third-Party Services
- **No Third-Party Analytics**: SkyChrono does not use analytics SDKs that track users.
- **No Advertising**: SkyChrono does not display ads and does not share data with advertisers.

## 4. Security
Because SkyChrono processes and stores data locally, the security of stored preferences depends on your device security. We recommend using iOS security features such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and keeping iOS updated.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
SkyChrono does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app is suitable for all ages and does not contain objectionable content.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted in this file with a revised “Last updated” date.

## 7. Contact Us
If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, contact:
- **Email**: [steven.wijaya2001@gmail.com](mailto:steven.wijaya2001@gmail.com?subject=SkyChrono%20Privacy%20Policy%20Inquiry)

Thank you for using **SkyChrono**.
